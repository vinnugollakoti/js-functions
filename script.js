//Challenge 1
// Step 1: Create a function with the function name as ageCalculator and pass two parameters, first one is birthYear and the second one is the presentYear.
//Step 2: Pass two arguments as birthYear and presentYear while calling the function.
//Step 3: Calculate the possible age and return it.
//Step 4: Display the age on the console.
// Your code goes here
function ageCalculater(bYear, pYear) {
  age = pYeaar - bYear;
  return age;
}
let bYear = 1995;
let pYear = 2023;
console.log(ageCalculater(bYear, pYear));
//Challenge 2: Following is the code snippet commented , remove the comments and get started with the challenge. Find the errors and rewrite the function.

function Addition(a,b) {
  let sum = a+b;
  return sum;
}
console.log(Addition(2,3));

//Challenge 3:
// Step 1: Declare the variable "x" with "var" keyword and store a string value "I can access it."
//Step 2: Console log the value above the declaration of x variable.
//Step 3: Console log the value after the decalaration of x.
console.log(x);
var x = "I can access it.";
console.log(x);

//Challenge 4: Create an arrow function for adding two numbers. Console log the value.
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(add(2,3));
